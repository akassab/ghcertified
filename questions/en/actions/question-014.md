## Correct answer

```yaml
jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

- [x] Yes
> A matrix can call a **reusable workflow** with `uses:` and pass matrix values as inputs, running multiple instances of that workflow in parallel. This works across repositories (with appropriate access) and does not require self-hosted runners.
