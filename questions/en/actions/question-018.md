## Correct answer

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'release/**'
      - '!release/**-alpha'
```
- [x] the target branch name starts with `release` but does not end with `-alpha`
> For `pull_request`, the `branches` filter applies to the **base** (target) branch of the PR, not the head branch. The pattern `release/**` includes release branches, and `!release/**-alpha` excludes names ending in `-alpha`, so only non-alpha release target branches match.
